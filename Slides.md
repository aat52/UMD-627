# Final Project - Part 3


In this task, you should analyze your data with the goal of answering your research question. You will present your project to the class.

**Objectives**

Finish analyzing data to develop a final answer to your research question
Develop an interpretation of your analysis based on the totality of your results
Develop slides that provide a summary of your project and its findings
**Analyze Data  **

Answer the following questions (short answers are best now â€“ you will write a narrative for the final paper):

What statistical tests and/or models did you run and why?
Report the relevant results (e.g., test statistics, regression coefficients, p values).
**Interpret Your Findings**
Now that you are finishing the data analysis, you should take a step back and revisit your original research question. What have you learned? When interpreting your results, do the following things:

What did you conclude?
What are the weaknesses in your analysis? (For example, sample size is small, sample is not representative of study's target population).
What are the practical implications of your results? (For example, how does this generate new knowledge about something? How might these findings be useful to other people?)
**Develop Slides**

The final activity of this task will be to create a slide deck and present your findings to the class. Your presentation should cover all important aspects of your course project, including your research question, data source, main findings, and conclusions. This can be done in about 6 slides (e.g., 1 for research question, 1 for data source, 1 describing your analysis, 1-2 for main findings, and 1 for conclusions). Each team will give a 10 minute presentation in class.

**Deliverable**

Each teams submit their slides and presents their project in class.

**Deadline**

Slides are due by December 5, 2022

Presentations are in-class on December 6, 2022.

*You will likely need to meet with your group outside of regular class time to complete this task.*
