# Final Paper - Part 1

In this task, you will identify your team members and their expertise and allocate roles based on this expertise. One person should be responsible for scheduling meetings, keeping the team together, and submitting group assignments, we will call this person the “project manager.” At least one person should have some technical skills so that the team has the ability to acquire and manipulate data in R. At least one person should have subject matter knowledge on the topic that you choose for your final project.


## Objectives

Organize your team
Brainstorm a topic of interest and identify potential sources of data

Organizing the Team
There are two main activities for this task. The first activity is for the team members to get to know one another, to identify the expertise in the team, and to think about what roles members will play. This will help ensure that you have the right mix of expertise for a successful project. Three key areas you will need to cover are

Project management: One person in the team should be in charge of scheduling all team meetings, monitoring progress, submitting group assignments, and all other project management related tasks.
Subject matter knowledge: It’s useful if someone in the team has some familiarity with the subject area of the problem you’ll be working with in order to provide context and aid in interpretation.
Technical skills: Getting and manipulating data and doing statistical analysis using R
You can assign more than one person to a role (e.g., two people with technical skills can together take the lead on the analysis). 

## Brainstorming Ideas
The second activity is to brainstorm areas of interest for your team and identify sources of data for the area of interest. Some of you may have common research/work interests, so this common interest could serve as a starting place for your brainstorming. For other teams, there may be a common interest in learning or refining skills, so an area of interest for one of the team members or that is of general interest to the team could be appropriate. For yet other teams, an individual member may already have (preliminary) data to share or you can take advantage of the wealth of publicly available datasets (e.g., www.icpsr.umich.edu Links to an external site.; kaggle.com) Links to an external site.

Here are some examples of suitable research topics:

user’s experience with a particular product
social media users’ privacy concerns
effects of health tracking apps on behavior
public sentiment towards immigrants
attitudes of potential voters toward a political candidate
exercise habits by gender
substance abuse by level of education
Once you have identified the expertise in the team and have identified a topic of interest, think about what kind of research question you want to ask and what kinds of datasets would help you answer that question. Discuss generally how you might approach the research problem and try to anticipate the challenges you might run into along the way.

Your research should involve a comparison between groups. For example, if your topic is sentiment in the U.S. towards immigrants, you will have to decide which comparison to focus on. Would it be sentiment toward different immigrant groups (people from Latin American vs. South and East Asia)? Different types of sentiment (perception of economic threat vs. cultural threat)? Or maybe different groups of U.S. residents (those with and without college degrees)?

The research question should be precise, clear, and achievable with one or more of the following statistical methods: chi-square test, two-sample t test, ANOVA, or regression modeling. 

If the research question is ambiguous, then you may need to further refine it (for specific guidance see: https://writingcenter.gmu.edu/writing-resources/research-based-writing/how-to-write-a-research-question Links to an external site.). It's OK to propose a research question that very straightforward. For example, do people like wood roller coasters or steel roller coaster better? Do younger adults or older adults tend to exercise more? What factors are associated with high GPA among undergraduate students in the U.S?

If you have a dataset that you want to analyze that cannot be used to answer you question, then you should revise your research question so that you can answer it with the data at hand.   

## Deliverable

The team’s project manager submits a 1-page document that lists:

the name of the contact person for the team;
a potential research question; and
one or more potential sources of data.
