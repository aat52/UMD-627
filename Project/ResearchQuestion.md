# Final Project - Part 2

Now you will acquire a dataset and take a deep dive into the data to evaluate whether the dataset suits your purposes. You may find that you cannot get access to the data you intended to use. In this case, you will need to search for another dataset. Then you will read it in, look at it, and make sure that some very simple aspects of the data are consistent with your expectations of how the data will be structured. Using these explorations, you will determine whether the data can in fact be used for your research topic. If not, you will either need to refine or revise your research question or find a new dataset. After this task, everyone in the team should be familiar with the dataset and feel comfortable with its contents and structure.

**First set of objectives**

Acquire a dataset
Determine if you have the data you need for your research question
If not, either refine your research question or acquire a new data set. 
Examining the Data
Examine your data. This should include:

Determining the overall data structure and the unit of analysis (e.g., individuals, households, countries). It can be helpful to take some time to think about and describe the process that was used to generate the data.
Identifying the key variables that you will use for your research and determining the “n” about whom there is information for these key variables
Understanding how the key variables are specified in the data (key question: are they categorical variables or numeric/quantitative variables?)
Determining whether you need to revise your research question 
 

**Preliminary Data Analysis**

Next you will upload all your data into R (if you haven't done so already) and perform enough data analysis to get a sense of the shape of the answer to your research question. Here you will conduct the “easy analysis,” and then challenge this analysis in the next task. Your team will start to do the statistical testing needed to answer your research question. This step may involve extensive data preparation, e.g., recoding variables from continuous to categorical, reducing the number of categories in a categorical variable (e.g., from 3 to 2), or dealing with missing data or outliers.

**Second set of objectives**

Prepare your data for analysis.
Note: there may be nothing to do here other than to explore how to specify your variables.
For example: Do your categorical variables need to be recoded? Do you need to create any new variables (e.g., a new measure of something based on the the one or more variables in your dataset)? If your key variables are continuous, should you create categories for any of them?
Produce a histogram, box plot, and descriptive statistics (mean, sd) for your dependent variable. If your DV is a categorical variable, descriptive statistics might include frequencies and percentages.
Produce descriptive statistics (mean, sd) for you main independent variable(s). If your IV is a categorical variable, descriptive statistics might include frequencies and percentages.
Develop a rough answer to your research question. This will involve doing some statistical tests. If you plan to run a regression model, you might just do other tests for now (chi-square, t tests, correlations), and in the next task you can try to run your full model. 
 

**Overall Deliverable**

The team’s project manager submits a 1 page document that lists:

your specific research question
brief description of your dataset. Be sure to mention the unit of analysis in your dataset (e.g., individuals, households, countries), as well as the number of observations in the dataset  (the “n” about whom there is information for your key variables)
description of your dependent variable and descriptive statistics for it
description of your independent variable(s) and descriptive statistics for them
preliminary/rough answer to your research question

## Deadline

Due by November 14, 2022.

You will likely need to meet with your group outside of regular class time to complete this task.
