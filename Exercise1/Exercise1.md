## Q1.

Some researchers argue that using social media makes people feel worse about themselves. Prof. Vitak surveyed students at Michigan State University about their Facebook use. Using her survey results your job is to propose an analysis of the data that would test the relationship between Facebook use and self-esteem. The data is stored as a large csv file ([here](https://umd.instructure.com/courses/1330960/files/68799102/download?wrap=1)), the first row contains shortened variable names, the codebook ([here](https://umd.instructure.com/courses/1330960/files/68799101/download?wrap=1)) explains what these variables mean. Your write up should include the following:

a) A clear statement of the research question

b) Description of the study design

What is the population? The sample? 
What kind of study is it?
What will be your independent and dependent variables?
What scale of measurement is used for your variables?
c) An exploratory analysis of your main variables

How many observations are in your data set? Are there missing values?
Create histogram for each of your main variables. What is the distribution of each of them?
Compute descriptive statistics for your main variables (e.g., means, standard deviations)?
d) A description of what can be learned from this analysis.

What do you expect to find and how will it address the research question?
Are there any limitations with this analysis (e.g. bias)?
How might these limitations affect your results?
 

## Q2

Employee_data.csv gives a sample of salaries of students who graduated from the MIM program. Using this data please answer the three questions listed below. Write up your answers in a Word document, include all your work (requested graphs, R code). To complete this assignment you will want to download the data [Employee_data.csv](https://umd.instructure.com/courses/1330960/files/68799047/download).

a) Create a histogram of employee salary (column "salary").
b) Create a normal Q-Q plot of employee salary.
c) Create a box plot of employee salary.
b) Is employee salary normally distributed? Explain, why or why not.
e) Assuming that employee salary is normally distributed, what is the probability of a MIM graduate in our *sample* earning greater than $60,000 per year?
f) Assuming that employee salary is normally distributed, what is the probability of a MIM graduate in our *sample* earning between $25,000 and $40,000 per year?
