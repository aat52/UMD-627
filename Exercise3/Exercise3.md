## Q1.

In this assignment you will be using R to analyze data on the million songs dataset (available in Canvas). I want to know whether songs from different genre's have significantly different durations. Please put your answers into words (donâ€™t just cut and paste R output).

a) Report descriptive statistics for each group (mean song duration and its standard deviation).

b) Evaluate the ANOVA assumptions of normality and equality of variance across groups. In your write-up, please include the figures that you created.

c) Conduct a one-way ANOVA in R to address the research question. Report all relevant components of a hypothesis test, including test statistic, degrees of freedom, p-value.

d) One-way ANOVA is an omnibus test, which means if you reject the null hypothesis it tells you that at least one mean is different, but it doesn't tell you which ones are different. Using R, get pairwise comparisons with Bonferroni correction. Based on the results, report which, if any, genres are statistically significant from each other (Sig gives p-value for a particular t-test). What would you conclude based on your omnibus test and pairwise comparisons?

e) ANOVA might not be the appropriate analysis approach here? Explain why. (No analysis is needed for this question).  

 

## Q2.

Becky Liddle at Auburn University published a study in 1997 on disclosing sexual orientation in class. She taught four sections of the same class, and at the week of the final lecture she disclosed her lesbian identity to two of the sections, and withheld it from the two others. She was concerned with the issue of whether disclosure would influence student evaluations of the course. The means and average variance for the two conditions, further broken down by gender of the students, are presented below. There were 15 students in each cell. Perform a two-way analysis of variance and draw the appropriate conclusions. Please report the F value, degrees of freedom, and p value for every test. Use the fake Liddle Data provided on Canvas.  

(Note: The means are the same that Liddle found, but because I could not control for difference in mid-term evaluations, as she did, the effect of gender is different from the effect she found. The other effects lead to similar conclusions.) 

Please answer the following questions:

a) Is there a significant main effect of disclosure? If so, what do the results mean?

b) Is there a significant main effect of gender? If so, what do the results mean?

c) Is there a significant interaction between gender and disclosure? If so, produce an interaction graph and explain what the results mean.
